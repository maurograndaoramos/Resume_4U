# Other Projects that may interest you

Here you'll find information regarding all personal projects that I may create in the future, and those that have already been completed.

## Pseudoscript highlighter for VScode

This project was made "together" with a dear colleague ([Ricardo Afonso](https://github.com/ricardo-afonso) and at the moment, mostly done by my friend. Adding it here, as I'm honestly keen on broadcasting his abilities and features that may appear basic and nothing to write home about to him, but pretty cool to me. And I'm also keen on making updates to it directly.
