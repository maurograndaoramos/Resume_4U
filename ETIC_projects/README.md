# ETIC Projects

Welcome to my **Resume4U ETIC_Projects!** 
This is where you'll find all fancy projects created during my PW23/25 course. It'll give you great insight into my general growth and learning process.

## ETIC_Eats

**ETIC_Eats** is an app written in [Pseudoscript](https://github.com/jorgealves/pseudoscript) (taught by [Jorge Alves](https://github.com/jorgealves)) during the first module of PW23/25. It was the first group Project during "Programação 1" and I'm particularly proud of what we've done here. Specifically, loved it for the team's efficiency and for the team's cohesion.

The team structure was composed of your's truly, as well as [Jessie](https://github.com/Jessiellen), [Santiago](https://github.com/Spereira05), [Rafael](https://github.com/raphaelmatiaz), [João](https://github.com/JoaoCardosoDev), [Ricardo](https://github.com/ricardoAlmeidaEtic), [Miguel](https://github.com/Soninho3) - You should pay them a visit yourself and see what these wonderful people have to offer.

## M1_Project

_"You can see a lot about a man on the content of his code, and the nature of his comments"_ - Some Guy on Twitter, probably.
And here, I'll share in advance, you'll find that my **Personal Project** for "Programação 1" contains a lot of tongue-in-cheek commentary and some hidden features in the App's code.
